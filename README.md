# The Kata Dojo

This is the website I produced for my final year project at Staffordshire University. The aim of the site was to provide a fun way of learning katas which showcased my skills in graphics and animation. This was achieved through creating comic books where a fight would take place and show the application of the moves in the kata, and through animations which showed the kata from different angles as well as animations showing their application.

## What is a kata?

If you're unfamiliar with karate, katas are a set of moves that portay a fight. At some point, every student is required to learn kata and are even required to demonstrate them for competition. Depending on your level, displaying a kata can be one of the requirements to proceed to the next belt.

## The problem

The problem with kata at the time of creating this site (in 2014/2015) was that there wasn't much outside the dojo where the student could learn the kata. There were videos of instructors doing katas, but often these would be filmed from one angle, so you'd miss what some of the moves were. There were also diagrams but often these were unclear. The application of the kata was rarely explained as well meaning students could easily misinterperet the kata as a dance and not fully understand what it is they're doing. Above all else, they weren't entertaining or interactive.

## The solution

My solution was to provide animations where the kata could be seen from different angles. This meant that students could see moves that previously hidden in other kata videos. I'd also provide animations where the application of the kata was portrayed (i.e. so the student could see how the moves would work in a fight). Finally, I'd also provide comic books where the user can not only learn the kata in bite size pieces, but there was also a story to it that could easily be followed and would make it entertaining for the student to read through and learn.

This site is where a karate student could access all of the comics and animations in one place, showcasing my skills in:

- Web Design
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- 3D modelling using Autodesk 3DS Max
- 3D animation using Autodesk 3DS Max
- Graphic design/editing using Adobe Photoshop
- Video editing using Adobe Premiere
